            //Create object literal
            //let x = {};

            //Create object constructor
            let x = new Object();

            //Double brackets mean interal property
            //which cannot be accessed directly in code
            //e.g.[[Prototype]]

            //Find the [[Prototype]] of the Object x
            //Normal/ Modern Way
            Object.getPrototypeOf(x);
            console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(x));

            //Legacy Way
            x._proto_;
            console.log(x._proto_); //undefined. Perhaps not
            //present in Firefox

            //Since every object has a [[Prototype]], two or more
            //Objects can be linked as a result

            //Prototype Inheritance
            //When attempt to access a property or method of
            //an object is made, the object itself is checked first,
            //followed by the object's [[Prototype]], followed by
            //the prototype of the linked object.

            //The Object. prototype is the end of the
            //prototype chain

            //The prototype chain for object x is one link:
            //x(object itself) => Object(prototype)

            //Arrays
            //An array is an object. Thus it can be created
            //through a literal or a constructor
            //Array Literal
            //let y = [];

            //Array Constructor
            let y = new Array();

            //Array.prototype has even more properties and methods
            //than an Object.prototype
            Object.getPrototypeOf(y);
            console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(y));

            //The prototype chain for array y is two links:
            //y(object itself) => Array(constructor) => Object(prototype)

            //Check if both the constructor and the object
            //are properties of the array y
            Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(y);
            Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Array);
            console.log(Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(y));
            console.log(Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Array));

            //The instanceof operator tests if the prototype
            //property of a constructor appears anywhere within
            //an object's prototype chain
            y instanceof Array; //true
            console.log(y instanceof Array);

            //Summary
            //All JavaScript objects have a hidden, internal
            //[[Prototype]]. Objects can be extended and will
            //inherit the properties and methods on [[Prototype]]
            //of thier constructor. Prototypes can be chained,
            //and each additional object will inherit everything
            //throughout the chain.

            //Constructor Functions

            //A regular function becomes a constructor when it
            //is used to create an instance of an object using
            //the "new" keyword

            //Initialize a constructor function for a Hero
            //with two properties "name" and "level"
            function Hero(name, level) {
              this.name = name;
              this.level = level;
            }
            //The "this" key word refers to every new object that
            //is created from the constructor

            
            //Create an instance of a Hero from the constructor
            //and save to variable
            let hero1 = new Hero("Barry", 1);
          

            
            //Get [[Prototype]] of hero1
            Object.getPrototypeOf(hero1);
            console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(hero1));
            

            //Create a method on the prototype named "greet()"
            Hero.prototype.greet = function(){
              return `${this.name} says hello.`;
            }

            
            //Use method 'greet()' on hero1 object
            hero1.greet();
            console.log(hero1.greet());
            

            //Classes
            //Create classes made up of other constructor
            //functions that have properties and methods unique to
            //only those classes or constructors but still inherit
            //basic/ general/ common properties and methods from
            //the original constructor, in this case: "Hero"
            //The "call()" method is used to facilitate this
            //connection or inheritance

            //Initialize Warrior constructor
            function Warrior(name, level, weapon){
              //Chain constructor with call
              //Connect new constructor to original constructor
              Hero.call(this, name, level);

              //Add new property to new constructor Warrior
              this.weapon = weapon;
            }

            //Initialize Healer constructor
            function Healer(name, level, spell){
              //Chain constructor with call
              Hero.call(this, name, level);

              //Add new property
              this.spell = spell;
            }

            //Add attack method to Warrior
            Warrior.prototype.attack = function(){
              return `${this.name} selects ${this.weapon}.`;
            }

            //Add Heal method to Healer
            Healer.prototype.heal = function(){
              return `${this.name} heals with ${this.spell}.`;
            }

              //Create an instance of warrior
              let hero2 = new Warrior('John', 3, 'gun');

              //Create an instance of healer
              let hero3 = new Healer('Jane', 4, 'garlic');

              console.log(hero2.attack());
              console.log(hero3.heal());

             // hero1.greet();
            //console.log(hero1.greet());

            //Prototype properties and methods are not automatically
            //linked when "call()" is used to chain constructors
            //"Object.setPropertyOf()" does that e.g. links the 
            //properties in the Hero constructor to the Warrior 
            //and Healer constructors

            Object.setPrototypeOf(Warrior.prototype, Hero.prototype);
            Object.setPrototypeOf(Healer.prototype, Hero.prototype);

            //Now all other prototype methods can be added afterwards
            //Moreover, prototype methods from Hero can be used on 
            //an instance of a Warrior or Healer
